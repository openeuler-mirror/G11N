## What is G11N

This is a place for open discussions, from anywhere in the world. Here you may find the latest industry insights and news, tech and globalization blogs, and learning materials regarding openEuler and its globalization process. 

We are dedicated to helping OS and tech buffs learn more about openEuler and OS trends,  and we welcome anyone who is interested in our project to join the G11N SIG and share fun stuff together.

## What we can provide

### Industry insights

To start with, members from this SIG will provide developers with up-to-date info and knowledge in the industry by translating carefully selected articles from major English tech websites and well-known research journals.

### Tech and globalization blogs

You can also find blogs in G11N. They are divided into the following two categories: Tech and Case Study. The tech blogs are written in English based on the Chinese outline provided by members of other SIGs while case studies are adapted from customer cases. 

### Learning materials

 To further support translation teams and help openEuler developers lower the barrier for contributions, the SIG will also open several columns regarding:

- OS textbooks
- openEuler training materials
- Globalization principles
- Cultural taboos
- OS courses
- Standard localization processes
- Tips for website globalization tests



## What you can do

### Discuss with tech gurus

In order to develop a more prosperous openEuler ecosystem, we also welcome suggestions on other sources of news, industry insights, and analyst reports. Please feel free to star, leave comments, or submit issues.

### Share your knowledge 

If you are willing to share your own stories and ideas about openEuler, or tips on globalization, you can also contact the SIG members to submit your work.

### Improve openEuler website

Three language versions (Chinese, English, and Russian) are currently available for [openEuler official website](https://openeuler.org/en/). We are constantly optimizing its content to provide better user experience. You're welcomed to give suggestions to help us get better. 



## How to use

If you are interested in providing your native language support in expanding openEuler global influence, please check for and join an existing translation team or create a new one. Please follow the *Translation Team Creation Guide* to file an application. New applications will be thoroughly considered before acceptance.

In addition, feel free to join the SIG meeting and discuss the globalization insights with us. You can find the meeting minutes and all related materials in the *Documentation* folder.

SIG meetings will be held regularly for knowledge sharing and Q&A. 

Stay tuned for more events!
